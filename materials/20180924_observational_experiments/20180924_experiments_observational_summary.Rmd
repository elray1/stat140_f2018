## Goal: identify causal associations

\vspace{-0.25cm}

 * Does changing the value of the **explanatory variable(s)** *cause* the value of the **response variable** to change?
    * Explanatory variables: whether or not a child eats peanuts, whether or not a child takes medicines
    * Response variable: whether or not the child develops a peanut allergy

## 2 Types of Studies

\vspace{-0.25cm}

 1. **Experiments**: The explanatory variable(s) are controlled by the researcher (the researcher randomly assigns the value of the explanatory variable to each subject).
    * Researcher assigns babies to either consume or avoid peanuts, and to either take or not take medicine

 2. **Observational** studies: the explanatory variable(s) are not manipulated or controlled by the researcher.
    * Babies either end up consuming peanut or avoiding peanuts, taking medicine or not, for reasons outside of the researcher's control.

 * To demonstrate a **causal** relationship, need to run an **experiment**.

## Confounding

\vspace{-0.25cm}

 * A **confounder** is a variable that is associated with both the explanatory variable and the response variable, but is not in the `causal pathway'.
 
Example: Suppose we let families choose whether their child is in the peanut consumption group or the peanut avoidance group...

## Factors and Treatments

\vspace{-0.25cm}

 * **Factor**: an explanatory variable under the researcher's control (different from R's use of the term factor for any categorical variable!)
    * Factor 1: Peanut consumption (2 Levels: Yes, No)
    * Factor 2: Allergy Medication (2 Levels: No Medication, Medication)
 * **Treatment**: A combination of levels of factors for a given subject
    * 4 treatments: (1) Peanut consumption, No medication  (2) Peanut consumption, Medication  (3) Peanut avoidance, No medication  (4) Peanut avoidance, Medication

## Four Priciples of Experimental Design

\vspace{-0.25cm}

**Goal: Prevent/Limit Confounding**

 * **Control**: Control sources of variation other than the factors we are testing by making conditions as similar as possible for all treatment groups.
    * Make sure that are no other major differences in diet between the groups, other than peanut consumption

 * **Randomization**: Subjects/experimental units are assigned to treatments at random to equalize the effects of unknown or uncontrollable sources of variation.

 * **Replication**:
    * Within Experiment: Each treatment is applied to more than one subject/experimental unit.
    * Across Experiments: Re-do the entire experiment under different settings

 * **Blocking**: Group together subjects/experimental units that are similar in important ways that you cannot control, then randomize the assignment of treatments within each of these groups, or blocks.
    * Block according to intial allergy test results.

## What to do in Observational Studies??

\vspace{-0.25cm}

We can't do control or randomization or blocking!!

 * **Matching**: Find study participants who:
     * have different levels of the explanatory variables of interest, but
     * are similar in ways that are not directly being studied
     * compare values of the response variable between these matched participants.
 * Closest we can get to blocking and randomization in an observational study.
