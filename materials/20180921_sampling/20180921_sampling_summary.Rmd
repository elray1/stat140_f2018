## The Course So Far: Describe Observations in a Sample

\vspace{-0.5cm}

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{tabular}{p{3.5cm} p{3cm} p{10cm}}
\toprule
Variable Type(s) & Plot & Numeric Summary \\
\midrule
1 Categorical & Bar & (Marginal) distribution \\
\midrule
2 Categorical & Bar & Joint Distribution, Conditional Distribution \\
\midrule
1 Quantitative & Histogram or Density & mean, median, quantiles, standard deviation, variance, IQR \\
\midrule
1 Categorical, 1 Quantitative & Density Plot or Box Plot & summary statistics of the quantitative variable for each level of the categorical variable \\
\midrule
2 Quantitative & Scatter Plot & correlation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

## From Now On: Use Observations in a Sample to Estimate Something about a Population

\vspace{-0.5cm}

**Population Parameter**: a number summarizing a variable across the whole population

**Sample Statistic**: a number summarizing a variable for the sample

Our Hope: The sample statistic will be a good estimate of the population parameter.

## How Do We Get Our Sample?

## Bias

 * For the sample statistic to be a good estimate of the population parameter, the sample needs to be **representative** of the population.
 * Definition: Sampling methods that tend to over-emphasize or under-emphasize some characteristics of the population are **biased**.
 * Common sources of bias:
    * **Sample Volunteers/Convenience Sampling**: just include people in the sample who are easy to recruit
    * **Bad Sampling Frame/Undercoverage**: only choose your sample from among a subset of the population
    * **Nonresponse**: some people selected for your sample choose not to respond
    * **Response bias**: your phrasing or survey design encourages people to answer a certain way

## Sampling Variabilty

 * Every sample you take is different!
 * Imagine taking 10 different samples of people in the US
 * Each group of people you select will have different numbers who support the president
 * So each sample will have a different sample statistic (different proportion of the sample who support the president).
 * Definition: The **sampling distribution** is the distribution of values of the sample statistic that you would get from all possible samples of a given size.  (We will explore this more in the lab today and in Chapter 17.)
